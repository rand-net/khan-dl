## ⚠ Caution
* Each Unit webpage(https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-1st-grade-math/cc-1st-place-value) currently contains more youtube ids than the lessons themselves.
* In order to resolve the wrong file name issue, titles of lessons from the webpage
    and the youtube video have to be matched against one another

* In matching those titles, some of the lesson titles from webpage are quite
divergent from their respective youtube tiles

* Eg., webpage_lesson_title = "Addition and subtraction word problems:gorillas", youtube_id_titles = ["Exercising gorillas", "Comparison word problems: marbles"]. The latter youtube title is more similar, but it is an entirely different video.

* If there is a solution to match these titles, submit a pull request.

* **TL;DR Few videos will be saved with wrong file name for some courses.**


## Installation

* Some videos for certain courses were mixed with different output slugs prior to version 0.1.5
